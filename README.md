# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator
## Explanation of project
I was tasked with fixing/adding on to some starter code to create a working password generator using the criteria scene below. I did this by creating different variables for each of my number,letter, and symbol lists in the global scale along with my most important variable optionsCart in the local scope. This optionsCart variable is what was used when a user would select each criteria they wanted for their password and would collect what was needed to form and create the password.

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```
